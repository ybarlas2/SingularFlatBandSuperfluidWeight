The codes to generate the plots and data need mathematica. Superfluid weight for two- and three-band can be generated from 2-band calculation.nb, 3-band dispersive calculation.nb, 3-band flattened calculation.nb 
and 3-band nonsingular.nb. The BKT transition plots are genetrated using FiniteTCalculation.nb. The three band Lieblattice model's interaction parameter for the uniform pairing condition is generate using RatioAB.nb.
Other codes are used for generating plot for the paper and the supplmental sections.
