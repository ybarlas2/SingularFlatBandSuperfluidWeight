The multi-dimensional secant method developed in this work, which is highly efficient and suitable for solving self-consistency gap equations including the BKT equation for multi-orbital superconductors with multiple order parameters. The codes to generate the plots and data need mathematica. Calculations for two- and three-band models can be generated from 2-band calculation.nb, 3-band dispersive calculation.nb, 3-band flattened calculation.nb 
and 3-band nonsingular.nb.
